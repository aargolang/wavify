# wavify
ever wondered what any file sounds like if it was interpereted as a wave file? 
## Brief
This program only tacks a Wav file header ontop of whatever file you specify and then writes that out as a copy. You can play the wav file in audacity or whatever program you use for audio.

### Usage
wavify <file_to_use> <output_file>

### Warning!
Playing raw files like this can make for some very loud and abrasive sounds. Always be careful and start your volume at 0 and bring the level up once its playing.
